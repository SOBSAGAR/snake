# Basic Snake HTML Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Instructions
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.
- The objective is to eat the red apples that appear on the screen.
- As the snake eats apples, it grows longer.
- The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the canvas.

## How to Play
1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake.
3. Eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the edges of the canvas.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The game adapts to different screen sizes due to the use of CSS Flexbox.
- **Randomized Apple Placement**: Apples appear at random locations within the canvas after being eaten.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions between the snake's head and its body or the canvas boundaries, ending the game when a collision occurs.

## Credits
- The implementation is based on the tutorial by [Chris DeLeon on Medium](https://medium.com/@chrisdel101/creating-a-snake-game-with-html5-canvas-and-javascript-7632e5db2ef0).

Enjoy the game!
